# Loan amount (A)
# Number of periodic payments (n) = payments per year * number of years
# Periodic interest rate (i) = annual rate / number of payment periods
#
# Discount Factor (D) = ((( 1 + i ) ^n ) - 1 ) / ( i ( 1+ i) ^n)
#

# A = $100,000
# n = 360 (30 years * 12 monthly payments)
# i = .005 (.06 / 12 monthly payments)
# D = 166.7916 (((1+.005)^360)-1)/(.005(1+.005)^360))
# Loan payment (P) = A / D = $599.55 (in this case monthly payment)
